Here are some CADs I designed for the robot.

- [Bracket4040](https://github.com/alejandro3141592/Autonomous-Mobile-Robot/blob/1e7f1775d88613526e4730f4a6d6ecb679e6fc83/CADs/Bracket4040.STL) is a bracket that replaces the expensive Bosch profiles brackets. We use it to save money in some no heavy-weight applications, where there is no risk of the structure collapsing because of the use of 3d printed supports. 
- [HoseHolder](https://github.com/alejandro3141592/Autonomous-Mobile-Robot/blob/1e7f1775d88613526e4730f4a6d6ecb679e6fc83/CADs/HoseHolder.STL) is a support for the hoses that are in the vehicle, so they are not just swaying, and the vehicle looks more organized.
- [TimeOfFlightWall](https://github.com/alejandro3141592/Autonomous-Mobile-Robot/blob/1e7f1775d88613526e4730f4a6d6ecb679e6fc83/CADs/TimeOfFlightWall.STL) is a kind of wall that the Time Of Flight Sensor can detect to measure the distance the steering has moved.
-  [TimeOfFlightWallV2](https://github.com/alejandro3141592/Autonomous-Mobile-Robot/blob/1e7f1775d88613526e4730f4a6d6ecb679e6fc83/CADs/TimeOfFlightWallV2.STL) has the same function of the previous one, but is adapted to the other vehicle.
-  [ZedCamCase](https://github.com/alejandro3141592/Autonomous-Mobile-Robot/blob/1e7f1775d88613526e4730f4a6d6ecb679e6fc83/CADs/ZedCamCase.STL) is a case we can fix in the vehicle to securely use the Zed Camera.
