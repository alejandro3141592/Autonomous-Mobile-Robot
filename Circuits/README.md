In this folder, I present an electronic circuit design in Proteus that corresponds to the steering system.
This circuit is in charge of a safety feature in the vehicle since it allows current to pass through to the steering motor. 

The circuit has two relays that are normally open, and in this configuration, the current passes to the motor without any problems. But let's say that when the vehicle is steering to the right, the left wheel bumps into the chassis of the vehicle and the motor continues working, then the motor will demand more current and will overheat, so to avoid this, some limit switches were placed in strategic places to be activated before any of the wheels bumped in the chassis.
These limit switches are connected to the coils of the relays, so they can close them and stop the pass of the current in a specific direction and allow it the other way.
